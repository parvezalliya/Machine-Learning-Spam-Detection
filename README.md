# Machine-Learning-Text-Classification-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains the code and resources for machine learning models designed to identify and classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning, this project aims to provide an efficient solution for email filtering.

- Algorithm Used: The code implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for email classification, leveraging its probabilistic model that assumes independence among features.

- Text Preprocessing: Email data undergoes preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal, enhancing the model's ability to recognize relevant patterns.

- Training and Testing: The code includes a training phase on a labeled dataset, comprising both spam and non-spam emails. Subsequently, the model is tested on a separate dataset to assess its performance.

- Vectorization: Text data is transformed into numerical vectors using vectorization techniques, facilitating input into the algorithm while preserving semantic information.

- Model Evaluation: Mechanisms for model evaluation, accuracy, is incorporated to comprehensively assess the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

- Input Data: Users need to provide an email dataset labeled with spam and non-spam classes for training and testing.

- Training Process: The training phase allows the algorithm to learn from the provided dataset, essential for model development.

- Testing Process: The code tests the trained model on a separate set of emails to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

- Adjustment: Users can fine-tune the code by adjusting parameters or incorporating additional features to enhance the model's performance.

- Efficiency: The Naive Bayes algorithm's simplicity and efficiency make the code suitable for real-time email classification.

- Accuracy: Leveraging content and historical patterns, the code achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

- Customization: Users have the flexibility to customize the code to fit specific requirements, adapting the model to different datasets and scenarios.
